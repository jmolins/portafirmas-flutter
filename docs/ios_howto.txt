HOW TO ADD TEST CERTIFICATES

1. Open the project file in Xcode.
2. Select the certificate p12 or pfx file from the file manager and drag that file into the Runner/test.certs directory,
   [my_project]/ios/Runner/test.certs/FILE.pfx.
3. A dialog will show up and ask you to select the targets, select the Runner target. Check "copy items" so the
   certificate is really copied into de test.certs directory
